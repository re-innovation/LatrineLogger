Overview:

This is a prototype unit developed for Water For People to monitor the use of pit latrines in various locations in Uganda.
This is based upon the DataDuino datalogging platform, but with some changes.
A 555 timer based capacitance to frequency unit is used to detect a 'flush'
The duration of the flush is measured and written, along with a date and time-stamp, to an SD card.
This is all based upon an ATmega328 programmed with the Arduino bootloader.
Code has been written for the Arudino IDE.

The Arduino files are include a library and a full sketch.
The files are:
libaries/LatrineSensor which needs to go in your Arduino libraries folder. This includes an example.
LatrineLogger is the full sketch for data logging. 

Previous commits in this repository include the Arduino code as a ZIP file.

The code also requires the following third-party Arduino libraries:
Rtc_Pcf8563 (http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/RTC-PCF8563)
SdFat (https://github.com/greiman/SdFat)

Both of these must exists in your Arduino libraries folder.
